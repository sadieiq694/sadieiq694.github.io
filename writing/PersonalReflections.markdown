##Personal

The Beaver Works Summer Institute proved to be an invaluable experience for me. I learned more than I could have ever imagined about communication, about the future, and about myself.

Before this program, I neither enjoyed group work nor appreciated its value. For the most part I viewed team projects as a nuisance and did not respect the input of fellow group members. The communication lectures completely reversed my attitude towards working with others. Because of Beaver Works Summer Institute I am now a better listener and I am more aware of other's feelings and the fact that there could be something motivating those feelings that I do not know about.

I also have a much better sense of what I want to do in the future because of this program. I loved every second of learning about and programming the robots and now feel confident that I want to go into computer science and engineering. My only reservation about these majors in the past was my passion for biology, but the guest seminars showed me that STEM degrees are highly versatile and research often overlaps into multiple fields. For example, Sangbae Kim, one of the speakers, works in MIT's biomimetics lab, where they design robots inspired by biological principles. This program was helpful in deciding what I want to do in college and as a career.

BWSI was both an empowering and humbling experience. Heading into the program I was nervous that I would be way behind everyone else as I did not get to complete as much of the pre-program material as I would have liked. However, when I arrived I realized that every single student had different strengths and weaknesses, and it was okay that I was not that comfortable with ROS because I knew Python really well. The program made me a lot more confident in my own abilities, but at the same time it humbled me. I realized that there is always someone I can learn from.

##Thoughts on Program

I have very little to say in terms of how this program could be improved. The one thing that I think the program directors and instructors should consider is keeping the teams the same throughout all four weeks. One thing that Ms. Connor stressed during the communications lectures was the importance of building trust within a team. She also explained that trust takes time to build. When the teams are randomized each week, people have no opportunity to build the strong trust that is necessary for a group to be successful. If the teams were kept the same throughout the month they would be able to work together more successfully.
