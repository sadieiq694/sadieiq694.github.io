Week One: Technical Work


  Goals:
  
  The first week of the program served as a period to set the foundation of ROS, Linux, and Python
  knowledge, as well as acquaint students with the RACECAR platform. Everyone started at a slightly 
  different level (some students had prior Python experience, everyone got through different amounts
  of the pre-program coursework), and for the first few days of week one the instructors were 
  primarily concerned with getting all students on a level that would allow them to succeed in the 
  weeks to follow.
  
  In week one groups also were given the task of programming their RACECARs to wall follow -- or, 
  drive forward and stay a specific distance away from a wall -- for ~30 feet as quickly as possible.
  Since all of the cars had the same speed cap (2 meters per second), the only way for teams to 
  differentiate themselves was by having a better algorithm (in terms of computation time and 
  oscillation levels).
