##Findings

The Beaver Works Summer Institute was a fantastic LEARNING THINGY. I

Planning is key
- Know what you are doing before you start; plans are fluid and may change, but this is a way to minimize wasted time
- brainstorm and decide on the best plan of action before setting out so you dont write a bunch of code that you end up deleting
- dont jump around frantically and try something else as soon as something doesnt work; stick with it and try to fix the problem
- TIME IS EVERYTHING; the more efficient you can be with your time, the more successful you will be
- make debugging easier on yourself; add print statements after conditionals or inside loops, write code bit by bit
- delegate tasks to save time, but make sure all group members know whats going on so you can help each other if you get stuck
- Things happen that you do not anticipate so it is always smart to have a backup plan.
- reach out for help
