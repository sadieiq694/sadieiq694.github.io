# Technical Work: Week Four

##Goals

The goal of the final week was for students to bring together everything they had learned and showcase it at Walker Memorial Hall on Friday, August 5. The exhibition consisted of three main sections: two tech challenges and the mini grand prix.

The first tech challenge was the same as the third week's challenge; Cars had to explore autonomously and avoid obstacles while recognizing and recording different colored blobs. 

The second tech challenge was somewhat similar to week two's challenge. The cars were required to detect a blob and based on its color turn either left or right. This is different from the original week two challenge because the cars were not required to use visual servoing and did not have to wall follow. The challenge was altered in this way so that code from it could be reused for the mini grand prix (see details below). 

##Approach
PLAN GOING IN

##Process
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED

- switched between several different plans
- wall follow for time trials, didnt work out
- originally wanted largest open space for grand prix
- ended up using potential field for both races
- extremely slow connection; had to walk around with ethernet cord
- zed camera malfunctions
- had to use instructors car because our vesc broke

Despite multiple hardware issues that took up huge amounts of our time, our group managed to successfully complete all three time trials.


- third in time trials
- second in heat
- fourth in final grand prix
