Week Two: Technical Work

  Goals:
  After week one, students felt more comfortable with the cars and basic motion commands. So, for 
  week two, these skills were built upon. The goal of week two was to gain knowledge in computer
  vision. Groups used OpenCV to process and edit images. For the final challenge, the cars had to be
  able to detect a red or green "blob," or, piece of construction paper, drive towards it using visual 
  servoing, and then based on the color turn left or right and wall follow to a finish line as quickly 
  as possible.
