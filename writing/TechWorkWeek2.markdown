Week Two: Technical Work

  Goals:
  
  After week one, students felt more comfortable with the cars and basic motion commands. So, for 
  week two, groups built upon these skills by combining them with basic computer vision. The main 
  goal of week two was for teams to learn how to work with images from the ZED camera using OpenCV.
  For the final challenge, the cars had to be able to detect a red or green "blob," or, piece of 
  construction paper, drive towards it using visual servoing, and then based on the color turn left
  or right and wall follow to a finish line as quickly as possible.
